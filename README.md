Use Plotly.js to create an interactive data visualization for the web

## Overview 
I was able to create a dynamic website that is interactable and displays the information for a specific drop down menu item. 

## Results
With my previous knowledge of HTML and JavaSCript I was able to create and host an HTML website that presents data of individual patients.

From the dropdown menu I am able to select an individual's ID # and visualize their information represented by 3 different charts.

## Summary
This intertactive HTML website is helpful in creating a presentable dataset that anyone can easily use from the start. The dropdown menu makes it easy to select an ID number and return all information about them at the click of button.
